First module, the Model module, contains POJO classes and has Gson dependency in build.gradle file. Second module, the Core module, contains all the 
core logic of the application. Core module has Volley dependency and Model module in build.gradle file, and contains Volley implementation for networking, and some 
utilities. App module is divided in sub-packages (base, main, movie, webview), and each sub-package is following MVP principle.
